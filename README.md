Data Structures & Algorithms Course on YouTube by Dinesh Varyani.
This repository is used to help track my progress and understanding on the subject matter.
This includes the implementations of each data structure as taught, as well as additional algorithms that tap on knowledge of these data structures.

Alongside, practices found online through other websites such as medium.com are done, where they are labelled as "Practice<insertname>.java"
